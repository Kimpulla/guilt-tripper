# Guilt Tripper - Runelite Plugin

Guilt Tripper is a Runelite plugin designed for Runescape, adding a unique twist to the gaming experience. This plugin periodically sends messages to players, humorously "accusing" them of playing too much and suggesting they take a break. And much more!

## Used Sounds

The plugin uses the following sounds in its notifications:

- oldman.wav: https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/grumpy-old-man-89761/
- laughter.wav: https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/3-155949/
