# Guilt Tripper - Runelite Plugin

Guilt Tripper is a Runelite plugin designed for Old School Runescape, adding a unique twist to the gaming experience. This plugin periodically sends messages to players, humorously "accusing" them of playing too much and suggesting they take a break. And much more!

## Used Sounds

The plugin uses the following sounds in its notifications:

- gz.wav
- laughter.wav
- ohmydays.wav
- sleep.wav
- deathsound.wav

All sound effects used in this project are my original creations.

To incorporate new sounds, replace the existing ones while retaining the sound names specified above. Ensure that the sound effects are in WAV format.

## Installation (not available at the moment)

1. Open Runelite.
2. Open the plugin configuration panel.
3. Click the plug icon on the top right of the panel.
4. Find the plugin you want, and click the install button.

More detailed instructions can be found: [information about the plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Information-about-the-Plugin-Hub)

## Usage

Once Guilt Tripper is installed and enabled, it will randomly send messages to the player during the game. Users have the option to enable or disable sound notifications. Additionally, there is a volume control feature available for adjusting the sound volume according to personal preference.

## Instructions for Adding Sounds

If you want to add your own sounds or modify the existing ones, follow these instructions:

1. Download the desired audio files and ensure they are in WAV format.
2. Replace one of the existing sound effects in the Guilt Tripper plugins "resources" folder, ensuring to retain the original file name.
3. Restart Runelite to ensure the sounds are updated correctly.
